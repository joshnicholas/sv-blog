title: Climate coverage isn’t just about prevention

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Building <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/newsletters/">my daily news emails</a>, it’s staggering the dearth of good climate coverage. It’s few and far between, and much of what exists is caught up in prevention.</p><br>
<p>Absolutely we need to reduce emissions and avoid 2 degrees. But we have also already locked in a certain amount of pain that will need to be managed.</p><br>
<p>This is especially true in countries like Sri Lanka that have (relatively) negligible per person emissions and little scope for further reduction. Many of these areas will also bear the brunt, thanks to geography and economics etc.</p><br>
<p>One example of it being done well is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/02/scotland-whisky-climate-crisis-heatwave-distilleries-halt-production">The Guardian</a> reporting on a heatwave that shut down some Scottish distilleries for up to a month last year. The quotes towards the end suggest this is just the beginning of a shift.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Experts fear that last year’s conditions may not be unusual in future. This week the environment agency is hosting a “drought summit” in London with water company bosses, as fears grow over similar temperatures this summer. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/08/uk-heatwave-to-last-another-week-as-water-warnings-issued">last summer’s heatwave </a> was <strong>made about 30 times more likely by the human-caused climate emergency</strong>. Some estimate that such heatwaves could be happening every other year by 2050 if emissions continue to increase&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;Helen Gavin, who researches climate breakdown and drought at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said such extreme events place stress on the environment and the economy. “<strong>There’s an impact already</strong>,” she said. “It’s not just hot and dry summers, but strange weather like we’ve just had – 18C in February, that’s just weird. And that <strong>messes up biological and agricultural cycles</strong>.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t isolated. And, interestingly, some distilleries appear to have foreseen and planned for this. That can be replicated as long as the problem is made salient.</p><br>
<p>Around the world we’re already seeing the impact of increased climate variability in droughts, floods, heatwaves etc. We have to start dealing with it, and that means drawing attention to the increased probability of weather events.</p><br>
<p>It means highlighting what policy makers should do about city planning and building codes, helping people and businesses that are disproportionately affected, sorting out food and other supplies etc. etc.</p><br>
<p>We have to stop treating the 2 degree limit as if it’s the finish line of a race that hasn’t started.</p><br>
<p><em>As usually my emphasis</em></p><br>
