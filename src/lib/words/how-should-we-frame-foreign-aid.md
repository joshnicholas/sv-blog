<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve always been inclined to frame foreign aid in purely self interest terms &#8211; helping others makes us all safer, preventing disease etc. But if we want our governments to increase foreign aid is that the best argument?</p><br>
<p>Terence Wood and Chris Hoy from the Australian National University have done an <a href="http://devpolicy.org/publications/discussion_papers/DP75-Helping.us.or.helping.them.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting study</a> on precisely this issue:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>All of the treatments, including the basic treatment, increased general approval of aid giving (by roughly ten percentage points) and decreased the percentage of the population who thought Australia gave too much aid by a similar extent. <strong>Simply providing people with some tangible detail about what aid is doing, and coupling this with endorsement from an independent expert, is enough to have a substantial impact on support for aid. </strong>The specific way aid is framed – basic information, appeals to national interest, altruism, etc. – doesn’t seem to matter much for these improvements.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>These are from their <a href="http://www.devpolicy.org/whats-more-effective-in-raising-support-for-aid-20190110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev policy blog post</a> about their paper. (My emphasis)</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Increasing the share of Australians who thought Australia gives too little aid was more difficult though. Only the altruism and national interest treatments brought statistically significant increases, and the increases were only in the vicinity of about five percentage points.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more to this story &#8211; for one the authors note that this is complicated by what participants believed the intention of the project is. But at the very least this confirms that low information is a major problem and seemingly any discussion is a good discussion.</p><br>
