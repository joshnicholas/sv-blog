<p>I cannot remember a book that has affected me as much as <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-life-of-trees-what-they-feel-how-they-communicate-discoveries-from-a-secret-world/oclc/1011108011&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the hidden life of trees</a>. &nbsp;Written by a German forester Peter Wohlleben, it contains stories of pain, opportunity, luck, loss, sharing, community, interdependence and equality. A tree is not just a tree, it seems.</p><br>
<p>Unfortunately, there is some controversy, and I am not capable of separating fact from anthropomorphic embellishment. Are trees really somewhat &#8220;conscious&#8221; (my word) of, and looking out for, their &#8220;children&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know.</p><br>
<p>But given reasoning, Wohlleben&#8217;s firsthand experience, and the numerous studies he cites, there must be a grain of truth to the notion that plants are more than I had imagined. That my tendency to rip up leaves as I walk along is not a victimless crime. That the &#8220;pain&#8221; compounds through generations.</p><br>
<p>Probably what struck me most were the descriptions of community, of interdependence. Passing on nutrients, creating shelter for one another. Partly because it requires the least blind belief &#8211; of course trees are better off together than alone. But also because it provides examples for the rest of us.</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Scientists in the Harz mountains in Germany have discovered that this really is a case of interdependence, and most individual trees of the same species growing in the same stand are connected to each other through their root systems. <strong>It appears that nutrient exchange and helping neighbors in times of need is the rule</strong>, and this leads to the conclusion that forests are superorganisms with interconnections much like ant colonies.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to stretch this analogy too far, but of course this could describe us, with a few tweaks. That it doesn&#8217;t is a choice. Would trees be the same if given a choice?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>A tree is not a forest. <strong>On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem</strong> that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity. And in this protected environment, trees can live to be very old&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;To get to this point, the community must remain intact no matter what. <strong>If every tree were looking out only for itself, then quite a few of them would never reach old age. Regular fatalities would result in many large gaps in the tree canopy, which would make it easier for storms to get inside the forest and uproot more trees.</strong> The heat of summer would reach the forest floor and dry it out. Every tree would suffer&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;<strong>Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping aroundfor as long as possible</strong>. And that is why even sick individuals are supported and nourished until they recover.</p><br>
