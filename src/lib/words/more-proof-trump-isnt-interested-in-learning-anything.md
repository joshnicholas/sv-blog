<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109421-the-fifth-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fifth Risk</a> by Michael Lewis, and, to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure that he does either.</p><br>
<p>It&#8217;s the story of the Trump transition. Or, rather, the lack of one. The book isn&#8217;t particularly long. More like a Vanity Fair column that got out of hand. Some of the vignettes of public service meander, too many are hagiographic, and there are more than necessary.</p><br>
<p>Lewis also explicitly repeats themes &#8211; that most of the problems with government are practical rather than political, for example.</p><br>
<p>But Fifth Risk is a brilliant portrait of what happens when the people in charge are thoroughly unconcerned with learning anything new. Either because they think they know better, tribalism stops them recognising anyone else&#8217;s competence, or they just don&#8217;t want to know.</p><br>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;A month after the election, Pyle arrived for a meeting with Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Deputy Secretary Sherwood-Randall, and Knobloch&#8230;“He did not seem motivated to spend a lot of time understanding the place,” says Sherwood-Randall. “He didn’t bring a pencil or a piece of paper. He didn’t ask questions. He spent an hour. That was it. He never asked to meet with us again.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle eventually sent over a list of seventy-four questions he wanted answers to. His list addressed some of the subjects covered in the briefing materials, but also a few not: Can you provide a list of all Department of Energy employees or contractors who have attended any Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon meetings? Can you provide a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any of the Conference of the Parties (under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in the last five years? That, in a nutshell, was the spirit of the Trump enterprise. “It reminded me of McCarthyism,” says Sherwood-Randall.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle vanished from the scene. According to a former Obama official, he was replaced by a handful of young ideologues who called themselves “the Beachhead Team.” “They mainly ran around the building insulting people,” says a former Obama official. “There was a mentality that everything that government does is stupid and bad and the people in it are stupid and bad,” says another.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again, I&#8217;m not sure we didn&#8217;t already know this about the Trump organisation. So far I&#8217;ve read every book Lewis has written, and I will probably buy the next as well. But this one may be safe to miss.</p><br>
<p>The writing is pretty good though.</p><br>
