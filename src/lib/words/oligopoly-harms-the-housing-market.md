<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3303984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interesting paper</a> from Jacob Cosman and Luis Quintero that finds the concentration of house builders has a significant impact on construction, and therefore availability and prices.</p><br>
<p>The research is from the US. But it is particularly concerning in Australia, where builders appear to be <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-11/call-for-reform-as-two-sa-builders-collapse/10606524?pfmredir=sm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping like flies</a> in the face of the downturn and investor pullback.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Our estimates suggest that in the average market a decline from six firms producing 90% to housing to five firms producing 90% of housing (the change in median from 2006 to 2015) with all else equal would lead to a reduction in the value of housing produced by 58%, a reduction in square footage by 60%, and a reduction in the number of housing units by 46%.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there are particular reasons for increased concentration in the states, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine the same is true for the mechanism:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>When many firms are competing to build, they build early to preempt their competitors. This increases total housing production, raises the volatility in the supply of housing, and creates a surplus of unfinished units. Conversely, in a more concentrated market, firms can time their housing production to maximize their profits without fear of pre-emption. This lowers production volumes but increases price volatility as <strong>firms with market power can opt to build when demand growth is strongest and charge prices higher above their marginal cost of production.</strong></p><br>
