<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s amazing where you find stories about the power of range and diversity in creativity and problem solving. This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/pandoras-keepers-nine-men-and-the-atomic-bomb/oclc/61315497&#038;referer=brief_results">Pandora’s Keepers</a>, which is proving to be a riveting account of the creation of the first atomic bomb.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>“Oppenheimer accepted the heavy security as a wartime necessity, but he adamantly refused to accept secrecy in one area: scientific discussion. Here, the normal security procedure of compartmentalization—limiting discussion to a “need to know” basis—was not followed, despite protests from Army Intelligence. Oppenheimer held weekly symposia on the pressing technical problems of the moment, <strong>inviting solutions not only from the groups working on the problems but from the important cross-fertilization of agile minds from other disciplines with novel approaches and solutions</strong>. Just as in fission itself, one small suggestion could set off a chain reaction of ideas at a rapid rate. <strong>This fostered a cooperative spirit that maintained high morale</strong>. It was also a major reason why the bomb was built in such a short time.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Oppenheimer appears to have underestimated the breadth of the task, originally envisioning Los Alamos as a physics lab on steroids. But it eventually grew into a site housing thousands of civilians from many different fields. Specialisation be damned.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br>
