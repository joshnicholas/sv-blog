<blockquote>
  the human mind is built to identify for each event a definite cause and can therefore have a <strong>hard time accepting the influence of unrelated or random factors</strong>. And so the first step is to realize that success or failure sometimes arises neither from great skill nor from great incompetence but from, as the economist Armen Alchian wrote, “fortuitous circumstances.”</blockquote>

<p>This from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2272880.The_Drunkard_s_Walk">The Drunkards Walk</a> by Leonard Mlodinow. You can see this phenomena everywhere from politics to sports. We are quick to assign cause and effect, blame and praise, without considering the probability of it having taken place.</p><br>

<p>It reminds me of the brilliant <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking In Bets</a>, which I might break out again for another read.</p><br>

<blockquote>
  When we look at extraordinary accomplishments in sport &#8211; or elsewhere &#8211; we should keep in mind that <strong>extraordinary events can happen without extraordinary causes</strong>. Random events often look like nonrandom events, and in interpreting human affairs we must take care not to confuse the two.</blockquote>
