<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m not really someone whose daily activities fit neatly in the guidelines. You’re probably the same. I was standing in line at the bank yesterday with a woman who is.</p><br>
<p>She needed to withdraw money. But <em>just</em> too much money to do it from an ATM. The bank, as is its wont, has invested in a battery of smart ATMs at the front of the branch. It now only staffs one of the six counters inside. The ATMs can do basically anything you would need of a teller &#8211; withdraw, move and deposit money etc.</p><br>
<p>But the ATMs have hard limits and absolutely no room for discretion.</p><br>
<p>The long line of disgruntled customers waiting to see that lonely bank teller attest to how many of us needed the flexibility of a human. Something, some<em>one</em>, who isn’t absolutely constrained by rules. Except, does this describe any of us anymore?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>…since Economic Man is incapable of being morally load-bearing, he cannot be trusted. He will only work if incentivized by material benefit, so his behaviour must be watched like a hawk, and his rewards linked to the observed performance of contract-specified actions… Britain’s employers have been taught this in business schools and the consequence is manifest in the annual Jobs and Skills Survey. Twenty-five years ago, most people said they had enough autonomy to do their job properly; that has since dropped by 40 per cent. <strong>The reduction of workers to automata</strong> has resulted in a massive loss of job satisfaction, and with it of intrinsic motivation: it is hard to be loyal to an organization that manifestly distrusts you. <strong>It has also forfeited the good judgement that comes from using tacit knowledge</strong> – the expertise that can only be acquired through experience. By definition, this cannot be codified, specified, monitored and incentivized.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/greed-is-dead/">great essay by Paul Collier</a>. And it makes me wonder what the future holds for services <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-are-the-truly-difficult-questions/">even if they aren’t</a> dominated by automation.</p><br>
<p>The metrification of daily life is well under way and is already visible in a reduction to box ticking. There is some discretion left in the world, but I have little doubt that the necessary surveillance and analytical technology will grow in leaps and bounds. The MBAs demand it.</p><br>
<p>So what does that mean for those of us who live a deviant life? Who need to withdraw <em>just</em> too much money, or otherwise travel outside the norm? Probably a lot more time on the phone, talking to similarly constrained call centre workers.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br>
