title: How little is too little overhead?

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A lot of my recent life decisions have been influenced by an <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2013/08/01/keep-your-overhead-low/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incredible observation</a> by Austin Kleon:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Low overhead + “do what you love” = a good life.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“I deserve nice things” + “do what you love” = a time bomb.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t about <strong>[shudder]</strong> <em>minimalism</em>. But recognising that unless you&#8217;re Beyoncé you can&#8217;t do it all. And even then, is your support team doing it all?</p><br>
<p>There is an incredible amount of satisfaction in working out what it is you want and stripping away the excess. But it can go too far.</p><br>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading a biography of Paul Erdos, called <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/man-who-loved-only-numbers-the-story-of-paul-erdos-and-the-search-for-mathematical-truth/oclc/906710820&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</a>. A man who took it too far:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Erdos structured his life to maximize the amount of time he had for mathematics. He had no wife or children, no job, no hobbies, not even a home, to tie him down. He lived out of a shabby suitcase and a drab orange plastic bag from Centrum Aruhaz (&#8221; Central Warehouse&#8221; ), a large department store in Budapest. In a never-ending search for good mathematical problems and fresh mathematical talent, Erdos crisscrossed four continents at a frenzied pace, moving from one university or research center to the next. His modus operandi was to show up on the doorstep of a fellow mathematician, declare, &#8221; my brain is open,&#8221; work with his host for a day or two, until he was bored or his host was run down, and then move on to another home&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if it wasn&#8217;t mathematics, Erdos wouldn&#8217;t be bothered. &#8221; Some French socialist said that private property was theft,&#8221; Erdos recalled. &#8221; I say that private property is a nuisance.&#8221;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t stripping away the extraneous in order to do what you love. It&#8217;s outsourcing the job of being a human.</p><br>
