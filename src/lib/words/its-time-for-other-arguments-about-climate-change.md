title: Its time for other arguments about climate change

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The &#8220;debate&#8221; about climate change is so poisoned it has brought down <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-24/malcolm-turnbull-liberal-party-fear-comes-to-pass/10160764">at least two Australian prime ministers</a>, and the very term is <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/9/16619120/trump-administration-removing-climate-change-epa-online-website">redacted from US government websites</a>.</p><br>
<p>So maybe it&#8217;s time to retire, or at least rein in, this line of argument. The externalities produced by burning coal and oil, from factory farming etc., have many facets that can be tackled. Notably, health.</p><br>
<p>Take <a href="http://papers.nber.org/tmp/83409-w24970.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recent study</a> on air pollution from researchers at Arizona State:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;We find that a 1 microgram-per-cubic-meter increase in average decadal exposure (9.1% of the mean) increases the probability of receiving a dementia diagnosis by 1.3 percentage points (6.7% of the mean). This finding is consistent with hypotheses from the medical literature.&#8221;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Burgeoning medical literature provides reason to suspect that long-term exposure to elevated pollution levels may permanently impair older adults’ cognition, especially in the case of particulates smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter, commonly known as “fine particulate matter” or “PM2.5”. <strong>The small size of PM2.5 allows it to remain airborne for long periods, to penetrate buildings, to be inhaled easily, and to reach and accumulate within brain tissue</strong>. The accumulation of particulates in the brain can cause neuroinflammation, which is asso-ciated with symptoms of dementia&#8230;&#8221;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>So, emissions are not just harmful to the environment, but human health as well. The suffering isn&#8217;t only in the long term, evident only in a computer model, but in the health of real people living right now.</p><br>
<p>It&#8217;s also worthwhile thinking about <strong>who</strong> bears the brunt of this. The workers in industries like mining, obviously. But as a recent hurricane in North Carolina <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/22/i-saw-florence-sending-millions-gallons-animal-poop-flooding-across-north-carolina/">showed</a>, polluting industries are also often situated in poorer areas:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors — and even without a hurricane — life expectancy in southeastern North Carolina communities near industrial meat growers is lower than in places without these hog operations. A recent study published in North Carolina Medical Journal found that <strong>residents near the industrial animal operations had higher rates of all-cause mortality, infant mortality, mortality from anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis, and septicemia, and higher rates of emergency room visits than the residents in the control group</strong>.&#8221;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>As Ketan Joshi <a href="https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1052699730382217221?s=20">has noted</a>, denying climate science is now akin to being an anti-vaxxer both in the scientific illiteracy required as well as the harm being wrought. But we can&#8217;t expect to win this fight, especially in the short time we have to take action. Instead, we should change the subject. There are plenty of other arguments to make.</p><br>
