<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Is Stephen Curry actually worth more than <a href="http://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/">$30 million a year</a>? How about Lebron James, Russell Westbrook or James Harden?</p><br>
<p>Five Thirty Eight make a pretty good case that NBA superstars are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-is-really-worth-344-million-and-other-tales-of-the-nbas-new-salary-cap/">generally underpaid</a>, relative to what they would earn in an open market.</p><br>
<p>But that analysis is based on their impact on the court.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the top-heavy nature of production in the NBA, and why superstars are so valuable just as a basic bookkeeping cheat code: They create surplus value for their teams (and more generally the league as a whole) that is funneled into less productive players.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the business case for paying Stephen Curry &gt;$30 million?</p><br>
<p>Well, according to <a href="https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/li_harrison.pdf">a paper by Harrison Li</a> at Berkeley, both superstars and wins add to the bottom line.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>..every extra win during the season will bring in .3% more revenue to a team. To put this into context, each individual win for a team like the Los Angeles Lakers, who gained about 214 million dollars in revenues this past year, brought in about 642,000 dollars.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>As only five players take the court at a time, one person can have a huge impact on winning. More wins mean more people coming to the games (yay bandwagon fans).</p><br>
<p>It also means teams can charge more for season tickets and premium seats, and more lucrative local television deals (something <a href="http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/20747413/a-confidential-report-shows-nearly-half-nba-lost-money-last-season-now-what">a lot of teams depend on</a>). Of course, not all of this is realised immediately. Television deals, for example, are negotiated only every few years.</p><br>
<p>When the Boston Celtics (my team) added superstars Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in 2007 the team&#8217;s salary went up by $25.5 million. But Li estimates revenue increased by over $40 million due to the extra wins and playing more games (thanks to making the playoffs and winning the championship).</p><br>
<p>So it seems like paying players does pay. Although this paper is a bit old now. It would be interesting to see some fresh analysis, accounting for the new collective bargaining agreement and <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/7/7/16077694/nba-salary-cap-effect-2017-18-3cd31f461067">stratospheric increases</a> in the salary cap.</p><br>
