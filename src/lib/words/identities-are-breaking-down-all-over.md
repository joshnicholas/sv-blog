<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s [not] funny how often I see lamentations for the way things used to be. It’s no longer pure! Whatever it is. These new people don’t get it. They ruined it!</p><br>
<p>They aren’t true Scotsmen.</p><br>
<p>You can probably think of numerous examples. This is supposedly the driving force behind right wing populism around the world, for starters.</p><br>
<p>There’s an interesting rumination on changing identity in a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos">recent Aeon article</a> on “hacker”. It sweeps through the evolution from curious kids playing with technology, through “cypherpunks” and “crypto-anarchists” to the modern, bro-y t-shirt and jeans Silicon Valley types.</p><br>
<p>It really gets interesting towards the end, as the author places this change within the concept of gentrification. As more people take on an identity, some of the difference, the “disaffection” as he puts it, disappears.</p><br>
<p>Technology was stereotypically the domain of “geeks”, who harnessed its power to build an identity, community and to express themselves.</p><br>
<p>But an influx of people without those same predispositions has left it a rather muddled identity. More people have worn down the edges, making it child proof.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>At the frontiers of gentrification are entire <em>ways of being</em> – lifestyles, subcultures and outlooks that carry rebellious impulses. Rap culture is a case in point: from its ghetto roots, it has crossed over to become a safe ‘thing that white people like’. Gentrification is an enabler of <em>doublethink</em>, a means by which <strong>people in positions of relative power can, without contradiction, embrace practices that were formed in resistance to the very things they themselves represent</strong>&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;We are currently witnessing the gentrification of hacker culture. The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, <strong>like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking</strong> over the subversive ones.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>From the POV of those who lament changing definitions, there seems to be diminishing returns to people taking on a group identity. The new people don’t have the same experiences as the founders. They have other identities that may be in conflict or demand different treatment.</p><br>
<p>It reminds me of something I noticed in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/coders-the-making-of-a-new-tribe-and-the-remaking-of-the-world/oclc/1076460563">Coders</a> by Clive Thompson. He gives this pretty innocuous description of what makes a coder:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>More than introversion or logic, though, coding selects for people who can handle endless frustration. Because while computers may do whatever you tell them, you need to give them inhumanly precise instructions.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This fits within the framework of the Aeon article, of an identity shedding its roots as of outcasts and rationalists to one that is purely functionary.</p><br>
<p>Just like national identities that shed ethnic and cultural roots, forming instead around civic ones. Flexible enough to embrace new people with other experiences and histories.</p><br>
<p>Maybe there isn’t really anything specific in the various, changing national, regional or activity-based identities. It’s just the result of falling barriers and more people taking them on. As ever it was.</p><br>
