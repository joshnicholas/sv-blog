<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>competition should not be defined by some arbitrary number of producers, but by whether other firms are free to enter the market. <strong>Ultimately, market entry is the key prerequisite of innovation</strong>. If the state imposes constraints on that freedom in such a way as to establish or maintain a single private or public producer’s market dominance, then it has created a harmful monopoly, by severely limiting opportunities for innovation.</p><br>

<p>Not sure I agree with this&#8230; This may be true for most goods but does not factor in the global, network effects of online spaces.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us return to the EU’s recent actions. The Commission levied its June 2017 fine because Google prioritized its own “comparative shopping service” over those of its competitors. And yet, anyone who uses Google and its various services does so freely, not because Google is somehow forcing them. They could just as well use other services, so <strong>their decision to use Google must mean that Google provides the service most useful to them</strong>.</p><br>
