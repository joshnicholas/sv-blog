<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s hard to separate suits from a profound sense of obligation.</p><br>
<p>I’ve always lived in places for which they are thoroughly, climatically, ill-suited. Yet they are still donned on the regular. As a signal that something is being taken seriously. Or that wearers take themselves seriously.</p><br>
<p>There’s a separation there, which has historical roots. But makes less and less sense with mass production and the shift of power away from the West.</p><br>
<p>The expectation-filling that guides (forces?) people to wear suits to work, weddings , court and interviews also seems thoroughly at odds with the notion of it as a symbol of power.</p><br>
<p>I’ve never seen this articulated as powerfully as in this <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/30/20869237/suits-control-menswear-decline">Vox piece</a> on the decline of suits:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Although the suit is historically associated with projecting elegance, authority, and mastery of a profession, those qualities hearken back to the days when suits were prevalent, worn by the Atticus Finches and Don Drapers of the world. How long until we realize the suit — while still used for special occasions and by a shrinking number of traditionalists — has become associated with the opposite? The suit has become a uniform for the powerless….</p><br>
<p>….When you’re in control, at least in relative control, from the C-suite down to the long rectangular table in the open-air office, you wear whatever you want, which is almost never a suit. It is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/14/17792298/silicon-valley-stylist-fashion-tech">vest or bomber jacket for men</a> , a blouse or a shell top for women&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a class element here &#8211; which the piece goes into. After all, the decline of the suit as de facto <em>serious person</em> attire is largely taking place in a handful of industries, countries and social strata.</p><br>
<p>And, just as with school uniforms, there may be something to say for suits as something of a leveller. As a well-beaten path into &#8220;<em>respectability</em>&#8220;.</p><br>
<p>However, as suits become less normalised, and more explicitly worn for unpleasant occasions like court, will the association become more sour? Will the power of suits leech even more?</p><br>
