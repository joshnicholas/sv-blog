<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>When we observe a success or a failure, we are observing one data point, a sample from under the bell curve that represents the potentialities that previously existed. <b>We cannot know whether our single observation represents the mean or an outlier</b>, an event to be on or a rare happening that is not likely to be reproduced.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>This is another passage from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2272880.The_Drunkard_s_Walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Drunkards Walk</a> by Leonard Mlodinow. It highlights a common bias, especially in the public space; that we judge actions purely by their results.</p><br>
<p>We readily assign praise for success and blame for failure, despite not knowing the probabilities and tradeoffs, or how the decision was made.</p><br>
<p>Take basketball for instance. The NBA regular season is just about to start and so we can expect plenty of ooing and aahing. But a shot going in is not what makes it good. Just as a missed shot is not necessarily bad.</p><br>
<p>A good basketball shot is one that maximises the expected value &#8211; taking into account both the probability of scoring (the player&#8217;s skill, whether they are guarded etc.) and the value of the shot (one, two or three points). A good shot is one that you can take again and again, regardless of whether you miss one or even a sequence, leaving you ahead in the long run.</p><br>
<p>A good shot is unlikely to be the one that makes you gasp, or that you remember later. A high degree of difficulty isn&#8217;t what we are looking for. Hitting an off-balance shot with time running out should be the exception.</p><br>
