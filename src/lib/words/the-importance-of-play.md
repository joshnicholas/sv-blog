<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve just started reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mind-at-play-how-claude-shannon-invented-the-information-age/oclc/1006810545&#038;referer=brief_results">a mind at play</a>, a biography of Claude Shannon. He’s the “father of information theory”, without which much of the modern world wouldn’t be.</p><br>
<p>Shannon reminds me of stories about Richard Feynman. Bursting with curiosity, yes, but also sparked with joy at tinkering with knowledge.</p><br>
<p>I sometimes feel like this is lost in a world where education is sold as preparation for employment rather than rounding someone out or living a fulfilled life.</p><br>
<p>On Shannon:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>“His was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play; he was that rare scientific genius who was <strong>just as content rigging up a juggling robot or a flamethrowing trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits</strong>. He worked with levity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the two. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself. And the marks of his playful mind—the mind that wondered how a box of electric switches could mimic a brain, and the mind that asked why no one ever decides to say “XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ”—are imprinted on all of his deepest insights”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s a little vignette from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character/oclc/1022267511&#038;referer=brief_results">Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr Feynman</a>, one of my favourite books:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;I laid out a lot of glass microscope slides, and got the ants to walk on them, back and forth, to some sugar I put on the windowsill. Then, by replacing an old slide with a new one, or by rearranging the slides, I could demonstrate that the ants had no sense of geometry: they couldn’t figure out where something was. If they went to the sugar one way, and there was a shorter way back, they would never figure out the short way. It was also pretty clear from rearranging the glass slides that the ants left some sort of trail&#8230;”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is this Feynman as a child luxuriating in experimentation and learning for its own sake, but also him repeating the story years later. Despite a dismal career as an myrmecologist, that’s how important and formative he thought experiences like this were.</p><br>
<p>Putting aside personal fulfilment, I wonder how successful Feynman and Shannon would have been had they not “wasted” time building up other adjacent stores of knowledge.</p><br>
<p>Especially considering how successful they were at bringing new perspectives and slants to established ideas.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br>
