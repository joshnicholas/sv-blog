<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Watching professional sports, you often see a team that is behind suddenly go into desperation mode. The clock is ticking, so a flailing three pointer is launched from ten feet behind the line. Or the batter suddenly tries to hit the skin off of every pitch.</p><br>
<p>In reality it&#8217;s often not so dire. And trying to catch up in one go will likely doom you to failure. Hence the refrain &#8211; heard in many sports, not just baseball &#8211; that the way to go is by hitting singles, not home runs.</p><br>
<p>Just get onto first base. The person behind you will try and get you to second, etc. Go for a two pointer and not a three.</p><br>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to win it in one go. You won&#8217;t be the big hero. But you&#8217;ve got a better chance of succeeding.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the weight given to big leaps, and in turn the relegation of  smaller, safer gains, as I <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continue</a> to read <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Half</a>.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We need to face the possibility that big influences are not as orderly or consistent as we expect, that <strong>the way things turn out is bound less by observable laws, forces or common factors than by the mass of uncommon factors, the jumble of hidden, micro-influences</strong>. Our habit of thinking of this as ‘noise’–and then thinking of ‘noise’ in turn as an annoying residual–diminishes one of life’s most magical elements.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of course, just as on the playing field, the heroes of academia and intellect are the ones who make the big play, not the tinkerers and exception finders.</p><br>
<p>But so often these big leaps wind up in incongruencies or pale in significance to the influence of smaller ones.</p><br>
<p>It&#8217;s not as sexy, but perhaps we should be emphasising something else &#8211; singles, not home runs.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We dream of laws and general truths; the practicality is often a patchwork of unexpected anomalies. Run with these ideas, apply them more widely, and you begin to conceive a world bustling with powerful but enigmatic differences that we just don’t see.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br>
