title: We need more technological ’bilingualism’

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Something that bugs me is the widespread, continued segregation of technology. Technology might be something you use, but rarely is it something you make or even understand.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m currently thinking of all the people who I WhatsApp whose eyes gloss over at the mention of encryption.</p><br>
<p>This is often reflected in organisations, with technology teams separate from the rest of us. There are obviously some exceptions. Notably companies where the product <em>is</em> technology. But more often there is little overlap between those that make the product (etc.) and the nerds who make it possible.</p><br>
<p>The overlap often takes the shape of particular individual(s). But we all have to become the nerds who make it all possible.</p><br>
<p>Technology is no longer something separate from the rest of our lives. If it ever was.</p><br>
<p>In newsrooms, the tech nerds are often off somewhere leaving the overlap to take the form of data or multimedia journalists. This isn&#8217;t enough. There are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/at_one_virginia_paper_coders_and_journalists_unite_to_make_sense_of_gov_and_data.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many important stories</a>, too much to <a href="http://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/03/04/for-fucks-fake.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miss</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612974/once-hailed-as-unhackable-blockchains-are-now-getting-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misunderstand</a> or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608248/biased-algorithms-are-everywhere-and-no-one-seems-to-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underestimate;</a>&nbsp;not to mention too many <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity enhancements</a>, for computers to just be a blunt instrument.</p><br>
<p>Anyway, all of this came to mind as I was reading an <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613063/ai-ethics-mit-college-of-computing-tech-humanities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Tech Review article</a> about the launch of a new multi-disciplinary college at the University:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>“The world needs bilinguals,” said MIT president Rafael Reif. In other words, the <strong>world needs engineers with a better grounding in the liberal arts</strong>, who can build more ethical products and platforms, as well as <strong>policymakers and civic leaders with a better understanding of technology</strong> to help guide responsible innovation&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Faculty at the new college will work with other MIT departments to cross-pollinate ideas. Classes will also be designed so that technical skills, social sciences, and the humanities are bound up together within each course rather than learned separately.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. But I&#8217;m not sure the solution lies in more cross-disciplinary study (although it is definitely necessary) as much as it does in employers etc. valuing people who aren&#8217;t cookie-cut candidates, who have more diverse or even tangential experience.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to do that.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br>
