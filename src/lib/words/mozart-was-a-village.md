<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It&#8217;s hard to fathom the mind of a genius. Although <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/index">I really enjoy biographies</a>, I often <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-first-tycoon-by-tj-stiles/">learn more of and from the world around them</a> than I do from the subject itself.</p><br>
<p>In the case of Paul Johnson&#8217;s short, brilliant <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Mozart-Life-Paul-Johnson/9780670026371/?a_aid=thambili">biography of Mozart</a>, it&#8217;s Mozart&#8217;s father that piqued my interest. The endless renditions of concertos, operas and symphonies went over my head. But the dotted references to Leopold Mozart, WolfGang Mozart&#8217;s father, humanises both the story and Mozart himself.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Leopold Mozart&#8230; the son of a bookbinder, was a well-educated man with a degree in philosophy who had come to Salzburg in his late teens and joined its musical fraternity as a valet instrumentalist.
</p><br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
He loved music and became one of the most learned musicologists of his day. He specialised in the violin, and his Versuch einer gr√ºndlichen Violinschule, published the year of Mozart&#8217;s birth, is not only a handbook of instruction but a theoretical work that made him well known in musical circles throughout Europe.&quot;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<p>Mozart didn&#8217;t suddenly appear, fully formed. He might have been phenomenally gifted from an early age, but that had to be nurtured by someone with time, passion and knowhow.</p><br>
<p>Unfortunately, its these stories that often get lost. We value and laud the individual, not the village. Leopold Mozart was well known by his peers, but how many know him now?</p><br>
<p>When you listen to Mozart&#8217;s music, if that is your wont, do you appreciate the wider sacrifice that went into the prodigy?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Leopold Mozart&#8217;s ability as a composer in addition to his work as a violin expert should not be underrated. But about 1760, according to Nannerl, he &quot;abandoned violin teaching and composing music to devote himself to educating his two children&quot;&#8230;
</p><br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
After 1762 he composed rarely and never after 1770-71. He is often seen as a tyrant toward his children, but the fact is, he surrendered his own future as a musician for their sake, and their progress justified his sacrifice.&quot;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>Definitely recommend <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Mozart-Life-Paul-Johnson/9780670026371/?a_aid=thambili">Mozart by Paul Johnson</a>. Even if you are a musical philistine (as I am), you&#8217;ll smash it out in a couple of hours and learn a lot along the way.</p><br>
