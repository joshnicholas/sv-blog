<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Robert Hooke is the poster boy for the notion that it is not sufficient to have a good idea.</p><br>
<p>As I&#8217;ve lugged <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Curious-Life-of-Robert-Hooke/9780007151752/?a_aid=thambili">Lisa Jardin&#8217;s biography of Hooke</a> around over the past few weeks, it&#8217;s been hard to explain who exactly Hooke was. You may remember him as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR-gy5TsPDQ">the ugly cretin</a> in Neil deGrasse Tyson&#8217;s Cosmos series.</p><br>
<p>But Hooke was so much more than that caricature. He was a brilliant polymath who coined the term &quot;cell&quot;, redesigned much of London along with Christopher Wren, built instruments for Robert Boyle, and was long-standing curator of experiments in the early years of the Royal Society.</p><br>
<p>He dabbled in so many things. Had so many ideas. But no one I encountered had ever heard of him. Hooke consistently got himself 90% of the way there, but it was others that scored the goals.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#8230;Hooke is the man who almost made great discoveries now tied to the names and enduring fame of others: Boyle&#8217;s law of pressure of enclosed gases; Newton&#8217;s inverse square law of gravitational attraction; Huygen&#8217;s theory of the isochronous pendulum clock; <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/when-time-became-ubiquitous/">Harrison&#8217;s longitude timekeeper</a>.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the notion that Hooke came up with Newton&#8217;s inverse square law of gravity, or inspired it, or something in between, that best illustrates this point. From my little research, it seems clear that there is something to Hooke&#8217;s claim. But it was undoubtedly Newton that had the mathematical brilliance to prove it, and for that he is remembered and Hooke is not.</p><br>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t enough to have the idea. The idea is nothing without execution.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Newton&#8217;s mind, priority lay with the person who had produced the mathematical proof of the elliptical motion of the planets, not the one who had proposed such a motion hypothetically in conversation, as part of a broad speculative discussion of planetary movement.&quot;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I really recommend <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Curious-Life-of-Robert-Hooke/9780007151752/?a_aid=thambili">The Curious Life of Robert Hooke by Lisa Jardine</a>. I&#8217;ve now read a few of her books, loved them all, and am shooting for the set.</p><br>
