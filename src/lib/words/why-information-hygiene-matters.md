<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/">struggling</a> with the notion of beliefs as the output of a transitory and “swirling mass” of complexity inside each of us. Myriad tiny influences we can neither observe nor prise apart.</p><br>
<p>But, assuming this theory is valid, the logical conclusion is that the quality of the information you allow in is incredibly important. If that which inspires your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">System 1</a> thinking is rubbish, so is your thinking.</p><br>
<p>From <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Asked to account for our beliefs and choices, how often would we say it was an unknown nudge from the flotsam of incidentals? <strong>‘I probably only believe this because I pulled the equivalent of a red sock from my mental laundry under the influence of the last thing I heard in a bar. . .’</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>If the incidentals are so important, unpredictable and seemingly invisible, it’s not enough to swamp the bad with good. The only answer is to be incredibly vigilant about what gets in.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps this will prove easier than <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/">culling</a> the poorly informed and conscious conspirators from our social networks.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br>
