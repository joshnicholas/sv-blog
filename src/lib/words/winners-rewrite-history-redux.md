<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Growing up in Australia I barely remember learning about Indigenous history. Certainly not the very recent history of settlement and colonialism.</p><br>
<p>It was probably in there somewhere. But my teachers obviously had a greater affection for World War 2 and Ancient Egypt than the very present and living history of a displaced people.</p><br>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDemography/status/1102421503839072256?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&#8217;m not alone</a>.</p><br>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the wounds are still raw, and the conversation around trauma and reverberations <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/kyle-sandilands-says-academics-are-rewriting-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so appalling</a>.</p><br>
<p>But every now and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we get reminders</a> of how awful it was:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>In this first snapshot of the continent, we have found that there were at least 270 frontier massacres over 140 years, as part of a <strong>state-sanctioned and organised attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people</strong>&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;Starting in 1794, mass killings were first carried out by British soldiers, then by police and settlers – often acting together – and later by native police, working under the command of white officers, in militia-style forces supported by colonial governments.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>There are still Australians who were alive when these policies were in effect. The massacres <a href="https://theconversation.com/amp/of-course-australia-was-invaded-massacres-happened-here-less-than-90-years-ago-55377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were ongoing</a> a decade after World War 1, an <a href="https://tasa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Donoghue-Jed-Session-13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">important point in Australia&#8217;s national identity</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;large-scale massacres of Aboriginal people were still being carried out through the 1920s and early 1930s in some parts of Australia.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>As the Australian media descends into another disingenuous kvetch over this issue, it&#8217;s worthwhile to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remember where our priors come from</a>.</p><br>
<p>Most of us, notably the non-Indigenous Australians, have experienced this history in an abstract way. Through the poor representations in school and the media.</p><br>
<p>Winners write the history? They also write the curriculum.</p><br>
